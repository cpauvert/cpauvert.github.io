At last, I've updated my personal page using [Pelican](https://getpelican.com) this time, but still relying on the awesome [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com).

I am hoping to document a bit more often my personal coding projects here, especially if I am to learn new skills. More importantly, I will try to document my code errors and how I tried to dodge them and gain knowledge in the process.

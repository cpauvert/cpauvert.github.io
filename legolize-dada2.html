	<span class="post-date">2020-10-08</span>
	<p>I finally have the time to properly use the workflow management <a href="https://github.com/snakemake/snakemake">Snakemake</a> which is great because so many recent developments happened since I&rsquo;ve heard of this tool during my master degree. The authors and contributors of Snakemake actually published recently a <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4067137">preprint</a> highlighting such features.</p>
<p>Among these features, one could be compared to LEGO&reg; bricks: Snakemake <em>wrappers</em>.  They are dedicated Snakemake rule that allow to plug &ndash; much like bricks &ndash; common tools to perform your analysis. These wrappers should pass automatic tests prior to their integration in the repository which safeguard against typos during development that hinders your workflow.</p>
<p>Bricks can even be assembled in dedicated sets, which in the case of Snakemake means that wrappers can be combined to design <em>meta-wrapper</em> where a common analysis workflow can be crafted using a selection of wrappers. This convenient idea enables the user to finely tune the level of modularity wished during the design of its Snakemake workflow: from custom rules, wrappers to meta-wrappers<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Snakemake use is rising and there was even recently a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.17.095679">preprint</a> for a <a href="https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/">DADA2</a> workflow with Snakemake. I was really excited for this huge contribution that, in my opinion, filled a gap. However, I realized that some steps were not parts of my personal workflow (such as the taxonomy) and that instead of this one well running Snakemake workflow &ndash; huge LEGO set &ndash;, I&rsquo;d rather choose from several DADA2 wrappers &ndash; piles of bricks &ndash; to build a more flexible workflow.</p>
<p>It all started when I realised that there were no DADA2 wrappers and even few metabarcoding related wrappers proposed in the repository.<br>
Last week, I then started writing my first wrappers by mimicking previous R wrappers listed in the <a href="https://snakemake-wrappers.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html">repository</a>. I tried to design toy examples to test the wrappers and I even manage to propose a few pull requests on the <a href="https://github.com/snakemake/snakemake-wrappers/pulls">Github repository</a>. However, I realize after going over the corrections proposed by the reviewer that I needed to carefully think ahead my wrapper and their articulations. Indeed, I first proposed wrappers using paired-end reads only which is not truly flexible. Hence some of my wrappers contained duplicated lines of code to cope with the orientation which violates the <em>don&rsquo;t repeat yourself</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">rule</a>.
Even worse, it sometimes adds complexity to steps that could be processed unbeknownst of the reads orientation. </p>
<p>Therefore, I put my pull request on a draft status and will go back to writing properly. I already put on paper the dependency of wrappers to read orientation in order to optimize this workflow. I hope to propose soon these DADA2 wrappers and eventually a DADA2 meta-wrappers as well.</p>
